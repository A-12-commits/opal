recently i have played few  javascripts and related MVCs like  DARTlang,Nodejs,Meteor,Derby,Emberjs,Opal,angularjs separately.
i am a FAN of rails framework
there are only ONE dis advance that i don't like on Ruby and Rails both, because of performance.
i think Ruby is amazing language compared than any other because of its simplicity and straight forward techniques.
Rails uses the power of ruby.
my opinion is opal should be write on DART VM, emberjs should be written on that opal on DART.

if opal is make like the one , which will be the amazing client side MVC for another 10 years in Web world

Golang which is a another important that rubiest have to consider. Go is the ultimate performance srverside language today.
if some write goruby(ruby on golang) like jruby, then ruby and rails will be the best framework for Web.
