h2. What is Vienna
Vienna is two (probably 3) projects combined into one. It is:
- A ruby compiler (written in ruby) that aims to generate high performance javascript code to run in any modern web browser. IE6+
- Ruby runtime, written in javascript for all base ruby classes. This includes strings, symbols, procs etc etc etc. All the usual suspects.
- A framework, written in ruby, for writing high quality web applications. This is targeted for the web. The framework is a rubified Cocoa.
