h2. What is Vienna

Vienna is two (probably 3) projects combined into one. It is:

# A ruby compiler (written in ruby) that aims to generate high performance javascript code to run in any modern web browser. IE6+
# Ruby runtime, written in javascript for all base ruby classes. This includes strings, symbols, procs etc etc etc. All the usual suspects.
# A framework, written in ruby, for writing high quality web applications. This is targeted for the web. The framework is a rubified Cocoa. 

h2. Difference in the two parsers.

Vienna includes two parsers. A more complete one written in ruby for compiling up front, and a second "in the process of working" that is written in javascript for compiling/code generation at run time. This is useful for meta programming etc and parsing whole ruby files on the fly. Combining this with the work done on bundles, require statements on the client are now possible, and file execution is halted until the required file is downloaded, parsed, and run. See class.js and object.js in core/runtime for the ruby runtime.
