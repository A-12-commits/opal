Browser demo
============

This directory contains a very simple browser demo. It is meant to be
run from within this repo, as it relies on the opal.dev.js.

Running the demo
----------------

To build the required `opal.dev.js` into the root `extras/` dir, clone
this repo and run the following rake task:

    $ rake opal_dev

From there, open `index.html` in your browser of choice and view the
debug console to view the additional output.
